# ChatGPT Prompt Automation Tool

Automating prompts based on presets and generating html reports with interactive marking workflows. Mainly for research purpose (e.g. accessing performance of responses).

Notes:

- Ensure the width of browser window is large enough (otherwise ChatGPT will use a compact layout, which causes this script fails to work)
- After ChatGPT stop responding, there will be at most 10 seconds cool down time (that's by design, as it's absolute possible to submit a new prompt immediately)
- Please keep the browser tab open! Avoid minimizing it as it might cause some problem.
- If you want to stop it...simply close the tab/browser.
